# dave-white/vim-latex

My personal version of the `vim-latex` plugin. Currently has only a small 
change to `texrc` and `compiler.vim` to allow for using the full 
functionality of the plugin when specifying the parameter 
`-output-directory` for `pdflatex`.

See the repo of the original 
[vim-latex](https://github.com/vim-latex/vim-latex) to know everything else.
